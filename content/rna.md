#### RNA

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding,
decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids,
proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of
life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in
nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms
use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the nitrogenous bases of guanine, uracil,
adenine, and cytosine, denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins.
Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.

Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling
gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active
processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins
on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome,
where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.
